    steps: [
      "To prep the salmon (454 g), first descale the skin. You can also steam it with the scales and skin on.",
      "Once the scales are off, remove the fish from the bag and rinse it in clean water to remove any debris. Pat it dry with paper towels.",
      "Cut the salmon into four equal pieces. Tear a stalk of scallion into smaller pieces and scatter them on the steaming plate. Place the salmon fillets on top of the scallions. This will add more aroma to the fish.",

    title: "Step 2 - Prep Aromatics",
    steps: [
      "Cut a few thin slices from the cleaned piece of ginger (28.3 g) and lay them on top of the salmon.",
      "Next, slice the white ends off the scallions (56.7 g) and cut into smaller pieces. Hold the scallion whites vertically and slice into thin strips. Repeat with the remaining whites and green parts as well.",
      "Slice the remaining ginger into thin slices, then into strips. Set aside.",

    title: "Step 3 - Prep Sauce",
    steps: [
      "In a small bowl, combine the light soy sauce (1 tbsp), dark soy sauce (1 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), cooking wine (1 tbsp), white pepper (0.25 tsp) and sugar (0.50 tsp) and mix thoroughly. Taste and adjust as needed.",

    title: "Step 4 - Steam Salmon",
    steps: [
      "Place a steaming rack in your wok and fill with water until it meets the rack. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.",
      "Once the water boils, place the plate of salmon on top of the rack, put on the wok lid and steam for 8 to 10 minutes on high heat.",
      "Remove the lid and check for doneness. My dad uses the chopstick test — if it’s too soft, it’s undercooked — but you can use an instant read thermometer for more accuracy. Once salmon reaches at least 145°F, it's ready.",

    title: "Step 5 - Make Ginger-Scallion Oil",
    steps: [
      "Carefully remove the plate of steamed salmon from the wok. Scatter the thinly cut ginger and scallions on top of the fish.",
      "Take the steamer rack out of the wok and pour out the water. Dry it thoroughly. Pour in the oil (85.0 g) and heat on high until smoking and very hot. Once heated, carefully spoon the oil on top of the ginger and scallions. Garnish with the cilantro (28.3 g).",
      "Drizzle the sauce along the sides of the dish, including on top of the liquid at the bottom of the plate.",
